## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome!
We're EOMLions and this is the official GitHub organization for both teams 7476 Aureus and 9127 Lioneers.

### What do we do?
As a software community, our responsibility is to, well FIRSTly write the code for our teams in the 2024 FRC Season Crescendo! But we're not staying limited with that, we're also collaborating with other teams, supporting each other throughout this way and contributing to collective knowledge. Our repos for the current season will be published after the competition. Don't forget to check them out!
